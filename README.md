#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I needed to write a program that parsed a text file full of different grocery store items, each repeating on the list a different number of times, and processed and output information on the quantity of each item in
the list in a searchable (one item only) format, a list with numerical quantity, and a histogram format. This was to solve a problem for the corner grocer customer that needed an application to help them keep track
of their inventory.

#What did you do particularly well?
I was very happy with my code's organization and how well I followed object oriented principles. I felt like the readability and understandability of my code is simple and easy for someone else to read and pick up
where I left off if necessary.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could improve my code by going above and beyond the "proficient" level of execution by including creative or more efficient coding styles to produce a similar or more visually pleasing result. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found it challenging to teach myself maps in order to execute this assignment and I overcame it by seeking help from tutoring resources offered through the university as well as asking for guidance from students
ahead of me in the program in the student discord. These will both be part of my support network going forward.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I could see being able to open, read, and write files will be very important in software development where you need to be able to make different types of software work with one another.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I achieved these goals by writing code that is neatly object oriented with a header file, cpp, and main. My header neatly establishes my functions and my cpp file defines the functions, and main executes all of them.
It makes it easy to know where to go to make changes to the part of the code you want to focus on.
